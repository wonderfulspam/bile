# Helper commands

This directory contains a set of reusable commands. This file explains
when to use which command.

## Usage

Commands are executables. Trust the shebangs. Commands may in some cases
be partially fleshed out; missing subcommands will have a placeholder
echo statement explaining what to do. Update these as you go when you
find a tool or command that works.

## Command overview

* [pre-commit.sh](./pre-commit.sh) - Run this when you think you are done with a chunk of work to verify that you cleaned things up after yourself
* [check-html.sh](./check-html.sh) - Validate and lint HTML files using tidy
