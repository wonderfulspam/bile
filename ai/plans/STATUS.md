# Project Status

This file describes the overall state of the project and what we are currently working on.

## Development Status

**Updated:** December 2024

Build system and core functionality are working. Content extraction is fixed but translation timeouts need addressing.

## Current Issues

**CRITICAL: Translation Timeouts**
- Content extraction is now working correctly (extracting ~11 sections instead of 509+ from TAZ.de)
- But translation requests consistently timeout
- Need to investigate and fix API timeout/content length issues

## Current Phase

**Phase 3: Translation Integration** - **PARTIALLY WORKING**

Implementation plan: [03_implementation_plan.md](03_implementation_plan.md)

### Recent Fixes Applied
- ✅ **Fixed TAZ content extraction** - Was pulling 509+ sections including comments, now extracts only ~11 article paragraphs
- ✅ **Fixed module loading order** - `BileSiteRules` now loads before `BileContentExtractor`
- ✅ **Removed duplicate methods** - Eliminated conflicting `siteSpecificExtract` implementations
- ✅ **Improved site-specific selectors** - TAZ now uses `.main-article-corpus > .columns.is-multiline p.typo-bodytext`

### Known Working Features
- UI button creation and positioning
- Content preview modal with detailed extraction stats
- Site-specific extraction for major news sites (TAZ, Spiegel, etc.)
- Precise content selection avoiding navigation/comments
- Processing status display in modal instead of console

### Issues to Address Next Session
1. **Translation timeout debugging** - Investigate why API calls timeout even with reduced content
2. **Token/content optimization** - May need further content reduction or API timeout increases
3. **Error handling improvements** - Better user feedback for timeout scenarios

### Completed Phases
- **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** - ✅ **COMPLETED** ([details](01_implementation_plan.md))
- **Phase 2: Content Extraction** - ✅ **COMPLETED** ([details](02_implementation_plan.md))
