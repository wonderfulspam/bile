# Project Status

**Updated:** January 2025

## âœ… Completed

- **Phase 1-3**: Working browser userscript with OpenRouter API integration
- **CLI Architecture**: Clean separation between `src/core/` (CLI-ready) and `src/browser/` (browser-specific)
- **Build System**: Generates `dist/bile.user.js` from modular components
- **Testing**: CLI test suite with 10/10 tests passing

## ðŸ“‹ Current Status

**All major functionality complete.** The project has:

- Working browser userscript for production use
- CLI development environment for rapid testing
- Complete core translation functionality
- Site-specific content extraction for major news sites

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

Performance optimizations. The userscript currently times out when trying to translate and we need to find and fix the issue locally using the new CLI.

Potential future enhancements:

- Additional language support
- More news site extraction rules
- Browser extension version
